## About the class

### What We'll Cover

This class will cover stuff I think is fun about language.
For example:
1. various tricks/pitfalls for programming with LLMs,
1. how formal language theory (e.g. regular vs context free languages) influences our understanding of LLMs, and
1. differences between computer languages and natural languages.

Material will be posted in the github folder as we cover it.
1. I'll adjust the topics on-the-fly depending on what's "hot".
1. If you have anything that you'd like us to cover, let me know.

> **Note:**
> This course is not <https://github.com/mikeizbicki/cmc-csci181-deeplearning>.

### Class Communication

We will be using github issues for all in-class communication.
    
1. Press the "watch" button at the top of this repo to ensure that you get emailed as new issues are created.

1. If you have class-related questions, you should post an issue and not email me.

### Required background

You should able to code independently and figure out how to use random libraries.

The hardest thing for most people will probably be my use of git and the command line.

If you're not familiar with these tools:
1. You might find the [CS46 unix/git tutorial](https://github.com/mikeizbicki/cmc-csci046/blob/2023spring/topic_00_unix/git.md) helpful.
1. The QCL has lots of people who are familiar and can help you.

The command line stuff might also be new to you.

Senior programmers have a (well-earned) reputation for being mean to juniors who ask dumb questions.

I promise not to be mean.
Please ask random questions about these tools throughout the semester!!!

### Grading

I'm treating this class like a graduate level seminar class.

| assignment type   | point value    | amount                |
| ----------------- | -------------- | --------------------- |
| homework          |  1,000,000     | between 1-15?         |
| final project     | 10,000,000     | 1                     |
| exam              | 0              | 0                     |

Final project overview:
1. Do something cool loosely related to what we talk about in class.
1. Put it in a github repo.
1. Present it to me in person during finals week.

If you see a mistake in this repo anywhere,
please submit a pull request.
Your reward will be that I will respect you.

### Collaboration Policy

Do whatever you want if it helps you learn.
But be an adult and don't do anything stupid.

### Accommodations

Just let me know what you need and I'll make it happen.
